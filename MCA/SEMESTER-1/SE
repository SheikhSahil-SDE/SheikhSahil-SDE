E = a*(KLOC)^b  PM = 26.928
Tdev = c*(E)^d = 
Person required = Effort/ Time = 2.692 
Where,
E is effort applied in Person-Months
KLOC is the estimated size of the software product indicate in Kilo Lines of Code
Tdev is the development time in months
a = 2.4, b = 1.05 , c = 2.5 & d = 0.38 are constants determined by the category of software project given in below table.
